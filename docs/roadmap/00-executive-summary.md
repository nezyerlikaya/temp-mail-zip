# Temp Mail SaaS - Executive Summary

Temp Mail SaaS is a Laravel-based temporary email SaaS platform designed for shared hosting. The goal is a modular, secure, production-ready application with clear ownership boundaries, admin control, localization, plans/subscriptions, public content, support/contact flows, monitoring, backup, compliance, and launch certification.

## Target Stack

- Laravel 13
- PHP 8.5.7
- Blade layouts and Blade components
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js
- Vite
- MySQL/MariaDB-compatible migrations
- Laravel scheduler with shared-hosting cron
- Laravel validation, policies/gates, events, jobs, and tests

## Core Product Scope

- Temporary mailbox generation and lifecycle
- Domain inventory, health, pool management, and provider intake
- Message verification, normalization, storage, retention, cleanup, abuse controls, rate limits, and quarantine
- Authentication, authorization, staff/admin management, profile, avatar, public identity, and reputation
- Plans, subscriptions, feature gates, API access, developer portal
- Blog, knowledge base, documentation, contact center, SEO, search, sitemap, localization, translation
- Public homepage experience with Atlas, Horizon, and Legacy themes, safe Appearance controls, sections, ads, fonts, RTL/LTR behavior, and mailbox controls
- Monitoring, audit center, public status, compliance, backup, disaster recovery, production hardening, launch readiness, platform certification

## Out Of Scope For v1

- Marketplace
- Community
- SDK
- AI translation
- Semantic or AI search
- Advanced analytics

These must not leave placeholder modules, compatibility hooks, routes, tables, jobs, DTOs, services, admin screens, or speculative abstractions in v1.

## Architecture Direction

The project must be modular. Each domain owns one concept and exposes it through services/resolvers/contracts only where useful. No unrelated responsibilities should be placed into a single controller, model, service, or file.

Frontend must use Blade, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Vite, named routes, localization keys, layouts, reusable components, and theme tokens. Raw standalone HTML pages, page builders, arbitrary CSS editors, arbitrary JavaScript editors, and static admin screens are not allowed.

Shared hosting is a first-class constraint. No daemon-only design, no mandatory long-running workers, no Docker/VPS/Redis-only assumption, and no heavy synchronous public request processing.

## Final Goal

Produce a clean, secure, testable Temp Mail SaaS that can be deployed on shared hosting without architectural residue from removed or speculative features.
